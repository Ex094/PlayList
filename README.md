# PlayList
A simple python script to create a Text File with all the names of your music from your offline collection.

## Motivation
Since I have an offline collection of my favorite music, I primarily use Windows Media Player to listen to my collection but recently there was a need to generate a list containing names of all the music from my collection which I couldn't do manually as the collection was huge so I created this small python script to scrape the names of all the files in your collections folder.

## HOW TO
Run the script by typing this command in your console

<pre>python play_list.py</pre>

Then enter the PATH to the folder containing your music collection

## Points
